The sole purpose of the source code is to elucidate programming examples
that are directly related to the topics discussed in this book.
Minimal attention is given to essential software engineering concerns
such as robust error handling, security risks, numerical stability,
rounding errors, or ill-conditioned functions. You are responsible
for addressing these concerns should you decide to use any of the
source code in your own programs.

The Common folder contains shared C++ files. This code/data should not be used
for other purposes without proper modifications. 

The CM folder contains files used by CMake.
